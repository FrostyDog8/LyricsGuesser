## Getting Started

### Local Development

Simply open `index.html` in a web browser. No installation or build process required!

### Deploying to GitHub Pages

1. **Create a GitHub repository:**
   - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and create a new repository
   - Name it `lyrics-figure` (or any name you prefer)
   - Don't initialize with README (we already have one)

2. **Push your code:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/lyrics-figure.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. **Enable GitHub Pages:**
   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Click "Settings" → "Pages"
   - Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
   - Choose "main" branch and "/ (root)" folder
   - Click "Save"
   - Your site will be live at: `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/lyrics-figure/`

### Updating the Live Version

When you want to update the public version:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your update description"
git push
```

GitHub Pages will automatically update within a few minutes!

## How It Works

### Song Selection Algorithm

The game uses an optimized year-based selection algorithm:

1. **Weighted Year Selection**: Randomly selects a year from 1960 to present, weighted by the number of songs per year
2. **Year Fetching**: Fetches only the top k songs for that specific year (instead of all songs)
3. **Song Filtering**: Filters for original versions and English-only songs
4. **Retry Logic**: If a year fetch fails, automatically selects a new random year

This approach is **3-10x faster** than fetching all songs upfront while maintaining the same weighted probability distribution.

### Lyrics Processing

- Lyrics are fetched from multiple APIs (lyrics.ovh, LRCLIB) with fallback logic
- Lyrics are parsed into individual words while preserving line structure
- Words are normalized (lowercase, punctuation removed) for matching
- Special handling for "oh" variants (ooh, ohh, etc.) - guessing any reveals all

### Word Matching

- As you type words, the game checks if they match any unfound words in the lyrics
- Matching is case-insensitive and ignores punctuation
- Matching words are revealed in their correct positions with a smooth animation
- The game tracks your progress and celebrates when you complete the song

### Preloading System

- **Global Preload Queue**: Maintains 3 preloaded songs for "Surprise Me" mode
- **Artist Preload Queue**: Maintains 3 preloaded songs for "Surprise by Artist" mode
- Preloading runs in the background and doesn't interfere with user-initiated song loading
- Songs are preloaded one at a time to avoid overwhelming the API

## Technical Details

### APIs Used

- **Lyrics APIs**:
  - `lyrics.ovh` (primary)
  - `LRCLIB` (fallback)
  
- **Song Metadata APIs**:
  - iTunes Search API (for song metadata and popularity)
  - Last.fm API (for global popularity charts)
  - Apple Marketing Tools RSS API (fallback for charts)

### Performance Optimizations

- **Year-based fetching**: Only fetches 4-15 songs per request instead of 1000+
- **Caching**: Caches chart songs for 1 hour to reduce API calls
- **Preloading**: Background preloading for instant song switching
- **Retry logic**: Smart retry with different years if a fetch fails

### Browser Compatibility

Works best in modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) that support:
- ES6+ JavaScript
- Fetch API
- CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Local Storage (for dev mode preferences)

## Version History

- **v1.2**: Curated song list (songs-by-year.json), embedded list for local + live, Surprise Me uses curated list, preload limit 5
- **v1.1**: Optimized song selection with year-based fetching, dev mode improvements (year/rank/source display)
- **v1.0**: Initial release with core gameplay features
